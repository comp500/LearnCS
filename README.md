# Welcome to Learn CS

This website allows you to learn Computer Science! We support the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) programming language to create programs.

Our *upcoming* content will use the [7517 AQA Syllabus](http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517) for learning, but a lot of content will apply to other A Levels or GCSEs as well.
